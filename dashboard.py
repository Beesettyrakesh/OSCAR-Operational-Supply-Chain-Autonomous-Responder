"""
Streamlit "Incident Command Center" cockpit for the Incident Commander.

The judge-facing window into an otherwise headless agent — a production-style operations
console, not a chatbot. It visualizes the agent's live reasoning as a step-by-step activity
log, with the State Ledger driving a business vitals strip and a plain-English resolution.

Three zones:
  * Zone 1 — vitals strip: projected loss / revenue at risk / status.
  * Zone 2 — activity log (the hero): each step as a uniform labeled line; the guardrail step
             uses a green/red box, and the inline Approve/Reject buttons render here when a
             spend breach awaits a human verdict.
  * Zone 3 — resolution summary: a plain-English outcome with a green/red status label.

Key mechanics:
- Background agent thread: Streamlit re-runs the whole script on every interaction, so the
  long-running async loop runs on a worker thread (`ledger_store.STORE` is thread-safe).
- Observational `on_event` stream: the orchestrator narrates every step; we buffer and render
  those events as they arrive.
- Async HITL bridge: `human_decision` runs inside the agent thread's event loop, so it awaits
  an `asyncio.Event` the UI thread wakes via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe` (never blocking).
- Live/Offline toggle: defaults to the deterministic offline planner to protect the free tier.

Run it with:  `streamlit run dashboard.py`
