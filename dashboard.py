============
Streamlit presentation layer for the Autonomous Supply Chain Incident Commander — the
"Incident Command Center" cockpit.

This is the judge-facing window into an otherwise headless, autonomous agent. It is
deliberately a production-style operations CONSOLE, not a chatbot: the Incident Commander is
incident-triggered and self-driving, so a chat box would misrepresent it. It visualizes the
agent's live reasoning as a step-by-step activity log, with the Structured State Ledger
driving a business vitals strip and a plain-English resolution summary.

Three zones:
  * Zone 1 — VITALS strip: projected loss / revenue at risk / status.
  * Zone 2 — ACTIVITY LOG (the hero): each step rendered as a uniform, single-font line with
             a bold label (Reasoning / Action / Finding / Negotiation / Human Review). The
             guardrail step uses a green/red status box; the inline Approve/Reject buttons
             render here when a spend breach awaits a human verdict.
  * Zone 3 — RESOLUTION summary: a plain-English outcome with a green/red status label.

Design (why it's built this way):
- **Background agent thread.** Streamlit re-runs the whole script on every interaction; the
  agent is a long-running async loop. We run `asyncio.run(commander.run())` on a worker
  thread so the UI stays responsive. `ledger_store.STORE` is already thread-safe (RLock).
- **Observational `on_event` stream.** The orchestrator narrates every step through an
  `on_event(kind, message, data)` sink (purely observational — it never affects control
  flow). We append those events and render them as they arrive; in LIVE (Gemini) mode the
  real model latency naturally spaces the steps out (no artificial pacing).
- **ASYNC HITL bridge.** The orchestrator's `human_decision` runs INSIDE the agent thread's
  asyncio event loop. A blocking wait there would freeze that loop (and the concurrent
  negotiation sub-graph). We inject an ASYNC callback that `await`s an `asyncio.Event`; the
  UI thread wakes it via `loop.call_soon_threadsafe`.
- **Live/Offline toggle.** The free Gemini tier is ~20 req/day; rehearsing on the live model
  would exhaust quota. The sidebar defaults to the deterministic OFFLINE planner and flips to
  LIVE Gemini only for the final take. The engaged core is shown in the header so it's never
  ambiguous which reasoning core actually ran.

Run it with:  `streamlit run dashboard.py`
