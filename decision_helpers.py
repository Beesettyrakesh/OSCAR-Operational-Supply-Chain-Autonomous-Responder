====================
Purely computational Python tools (Section 4.2) — the *Decision Helpers*.

These are deterministic mathematical engines. The LLM core is PHYSICALLY FORBIDDEN from
calculating financial impact or strategy scores qualitatively inside its prompt context;
it must delegate all such computation to these functions so results are reproducible and
auditable.

Day 3 scope: full deterministic computational engines. The public signatures and TypedDict
shapes are frozen from Day 1 and MUST NOT change; only the internal math is upgraded from
placeholder profiles to context-driven calculations that read real signals off the ledger.

      delay days BEYOND `inventory_days_remaining` incur shutdown cost. That shutdown cost
      per day is derived from the ledger's `production_shutdown_hours` (hours of lost output
      the incident represents) valued at the same revenue exposure basis.
