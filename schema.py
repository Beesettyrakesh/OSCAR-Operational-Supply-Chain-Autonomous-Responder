=========
The single, non-negotiable source of truth for the *State Ledger* data model of the
Autonomous Supply Chain Incident Commander.

This module implements the exact hierarchical Pydantic structure defined in Section 3.1
of the master handoff specification. The State Ledger is the ONLY object the Orchestrator
is permitted to read and reason over. No raw unstructured text, markdown, or conversational
tool output may ever populate these fields — only parsed primitives that satisfy the type
constraints below (enforced downstream by the State Mutation Layer).

Design notes:
- Literal[...] fields lock the reasoning space to a finite, deterministic set of states.
- loop_count is hard-bounded (ge=0, le=11) so the schema itself participates in circuit-breaking.
- revenue_at_risk_usd is a float because the Financial Spend Guardrail compares it to 5000.00.
